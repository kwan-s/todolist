## Todolist
Todolist web application made by following a [ReactJs crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A).
The purpose of this application was to familiarize myself with the ReactJs library.

### Setup
* Install **Node 8.10.0 or later**; but not required on the server.
* `cd` to root directory.
* Type `npm i` to install dependencies.
* Type `npm start` to start the server.
* Go to `http://localhost:3000`
